#### Crash report
To help us replicate an issue please include the ``crash.log`` file which is located in the ``/Magarena/logs`` folder.

#### Gameplay report
If raising an issue about strange or unexpected plays during a game, especially decisions made by the AI opponent, please include a ``gameplay-report.zip`` file. You can create a gameplay report by opening the options menu (press Esc during a duel) and selecting the "Gameplay Report" menu item. To attach the file, please drag into the comments box below.
