Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) is a tool for generating documentation from various code sources, including Java. It is a very handy tool for visualizing the relations between the various elements by means of dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.

The ``magarena.DoxyFile`` can be opened in ``doxywizard`` and should be ready to run as-is. It will generate the documentation in ``doc/doxygen`` (ignored by git).

Please note, that the "dot" tool from graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) is required to generate the diagrams and graphs.
