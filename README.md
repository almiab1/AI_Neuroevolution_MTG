# NEUROEVOLUTIONARY AI FOR MAGARENA
***
## About:
AI project. AI by Neuroevotulion method for [Magarena](https://github.com/magarena/magarena)

This project is the final thesis of Alejandro Mira Abad, from the [Degree in Interactive Technologies](https://www.upv.es/titulaciones/GTI/index-en.html) at the [Polytechnic University of Valencia](https://www.upv.es/).

## :clipboard: Abstract:
This project is about the application of one of the AI methods available in the field of
machine learning capable of learning and adapting to complex and variant environments,
which is able to play MTG(Magarena) intelligently and competitively. This is done through the
creation of an environment focused on applying the chosen strategy, as well as the
evaluation of the complexity of the learning task. A self-developed framework is
implemented, which is responsible for applying the neuroevolutionary method and
executing the various trainings.
